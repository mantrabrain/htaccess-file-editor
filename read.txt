FAQ

Can create or edit the htaccess file

Sorry, we can’t change the file access privileges set by your server. You’ll have to edit the file via FTP.


I edited my htaccess file and now my site does not work

You probably have a syntax error in the file or on the server you are not allowed any of the settings in your htaccess file.
Try to restore the original backup file. If restoration is not possible with this plugin, restore the backup file from the folder “wp-content ” manually.
